Sam Stone 
John Prine (live version)

Capo III

Sam [D]Stone came home,
to his [G]wife and family,
after [A]serving in the conflict over[D]seas.

And the time that he served,
had [G]shattered all his nerves,
and [A]left a little shrapnel in his [D]knee. 
But the [G]morphine eased the pain,

and the grass grew round his brain,
and [E7]gave him all the confidence he [A]lacked;
with a [E]Purple Heart and a [E7]monkey on his [A]back.

There's a [D]hole in daddy's arm where all the [Em]money goes,
and [G]Jesus Christ died for nothin' I sup[A]pose.
Little [D]pitchers have big ears,
don't [Bm]stop to count the years,
sweet [E7]songs never last too [E]long on broken radi[A]os. [A]Mm[Asus4]m.... [A] [A]

Sam [D]Stone's welcome home,
didn't [G]last too long,
he [A]went to work when he'd spent his last [D]dime

And Sammy took to stealing,
when he [G]got that empty feeling,
for a [A]hundred dollar habit without over[D]time. 
And the [G]gold rolled through his veins,

like a thousand railroad trains,
and [E7]eased his mind in the hours that he [A]chose;
while the [E]kids ran around [E7]wearin' other peoples' [A]clothes...

There's a [D]hole in daddy's arm where all the [Em]money goes,
and [G]Jesus Christ died for nothin' I sup[A]pose.
Little [D]pitchers have big ears,
don't [Bm]stop to count the years,
sweet [E7]songs never last too [E]long on broken radi[A]os. [A]Mm[Asus4]m.... [A] [A]

Sam [D]Stone was alone,
when he [G]popped his last balloon,
[A]climbing walls while sitting in a [D]chair

Well, he played his last request,
while the [G]room smelled just like death,
with an [A]overdose hovering in the [D]air
But [G]life had lost its fun,

and there was nothing to be done,
but [E7]trade his house that he bought on the G, I. [A]Bill;
for a [E]flag draped casket on a [E7]local heroes' [A]hill

There's a [D]hole in daddy's arm where all the [Em]money goes,
and [G]Jesus Christ died for nothin' I sup[A]pose.
Little [D]pitchers have big ears,
don't [Bm]stop to count the years,
sweet [E7]songs never last too [E]long on broken radi[A]os. [A]Mm[Asus4]m.... [A] [A]

[A]Mm[Asus4]m.... [A] [D]
