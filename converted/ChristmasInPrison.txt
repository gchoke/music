[Intro]

        [G] [C] [G] [D] [G]
[Verse 1]
It was [G]Christmas in prison and the [C]food was real good
We had [G]turkey and pistols carved out of [D]wood
And I [G]dream of her always ,even [C]when I don't dream
Her [G]names on my tongue and her [D]bloods in my [G]stream

[Chorus]

[D]Wait a while [C]eterni[G]ty 
[C]old Mother Nature's got [G]nothing on [D]me
[G]Come to me, run to me
[C]Come to me now
We're [G]rolling my sweetheart 
We're [D]flowing by [G]God

(Interlude)

               [C] [G] [D]
          [G]  [C] [G] [D]  [G]
[Verse 2]
She [G]reminds me of a chess game with [C]someone I admire
Or a [G]picnic in the rain after a prairie [D]fire
Her [G]heart is as big as this [C]whole goddamn jail
And she [G]sweeter than saccharin at a [D]drug store [G]sale

[Chorus]
[D]Wait awhile [C]eterni[G]ty 
[C]Old Mother Nature's got [G]nothing on [D]me
[G]Come to me , run to me 
[C]Come to me now
We're [G]rolling my sweetheart 
We're [D]flowing by [G]god

          [G]  [C] [G] [D]  [G]
[Verse 3]
The [G]search light in the big yard swings [C]round with the gun
And the [G]spotlights in the snowflakes,like the dust in the [D]sun
It's [G]Christmas in prison, there'll be [C]music tonight
I'll [G]probably get homesick, I [D]love you good[G]night 

[Chorus]
[D]Wait a while [C]eterni[G]ty 
[C]Old Mother Nature's got [G]nothing on [D]me
[G]Come to me, run to me
[C]Come to me now
We're [G]rolling my sweetheart 
We're [D]flowing by [G]God
