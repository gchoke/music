[Verse 1]
[C]Summer’s end’s   around the bend just   [Em] flying
The[C] swimming suits   are on the line just  [Em]  drying
I’ll[F] meet you there    per our conver -[G] sation
I[F] hope I didn’t   ruin your whole v[G]acation

[Verse 2]

Well you[C] never know   how far from home you’re  [Em]  feeling
U[C]ntil you watch   the shadows cross the [Em]  ceiling
Well[F] I don’t know,   but I can see it  [G]  snowing
[F]In your car   the windows are   wide [G]open



[Chorus]
Just come on[C] home      come on[Am] home
No you don’t[F] have to      be [G]alone
Just come on[C] home.
 (Intro)
[Verse 3]
[C]Valentines   break hearts and minds at   [Em] random
That ol’[C] Easter egg   ain’t got a leg to  [Em]  stand on
Well[F] I can see   that you can’t win for  [G]  trying
And[F] New Year’s Eve   is bound to leave you  [G]  crying

[Chorus]
Come on[C] home      come on[Am] home
No you don’t[F] have to      be [G]alone
Just come on[F] home.[G]      [F]     [G]

[Verse 4]
The[C] moon and stars   hang out in bars just    [Em]talking
[C]I still love   that picture of us   [Em] walking
[F]Just like that ol’ house we thought was   [G] haunted
[F]Summer’s end   came faster than we   [G] wanted

[Chorus]
Come on[C] home      come on[Am] home
No you don’t[F] have to      be [G]alone
Come on[C] home      come on[Am] home
No you don’t[F] have to      be [G]alone
Just come on[C] home.
