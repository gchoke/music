[Intro]
[D]  [A]  [D]
[D]  [G]  [A] [D]
[Verse 1]
[D]Why do you always seem to criti[A]cize me
Seems like everything I do just turns out [D]wrong
Why don't you come on out and des[G]pise me
So I could [A]pack my bag and baby I'd be [D]gone

[Verse 2]
[D]Remember when you used to call me [A]honey
I'd turn around and call you honey [D]too
You might think it's a joke, but it ain't [G]funny
To [A]hurt someone who's so in love with [D]you

[Chorus]
[D]A clown puts his makeup on up[A]side down
So he wears a smile even when he wears a [D]frown
You might think I'm here when you [G]put me down
But [A]actually I'm on the other [D]side of town.

[Verse 3]
[D]My body's in this room with you just [A]catching hell
While my soul is drinking beer down the [D]road a spell
You might think I'm listening to your [G]grocery list
But I'm [A]leaning on the jukebox and I'm about [D]half ... way there

[Chorus]
[D]A clown puts his makeup on up[A]side down
So he wears a smile even when he wears a [D]frown
You might think I'm here when you [G]put me down
But [A]actually I'm on the other [D]side of town.

[Instrumental]
[D]  [A]  [D]
[D]  [G]  [A] [D]

[Verse 4]
[D]I'm sittin' on a chair just be[A]hind my ear
Playing dominoes and drinking some [D]ice cold beer
When you get done talking I'll come [G]back downstairs
And as[A]sume the body of the person you presume [D]who cares

[Chorus]
[D]A clown puts his makeup on up[A]side down
So he wears a smile even when he wears a [D]frown
You might think I'm here when you [G]put me down
But [A]actually I'm on the other [D]side of town.

I'm a[A]cross the river on the other [D]side of town
In my [A]mind I'm on the other [D]side of town
