:Speed The Sound Of Loneliness 
John Prine 
[G]You come home late and you come home [C]early
[D]You come on big when you're feeling [G]small
[G]You come home straight and you come home [C]curly
[D]Sometimes you don't come home at [G]all
Chorus:
So what in the world's come [C]over you
[D]And what in heaven's name have I [G]done
You've broken the speed of the sound of lone [C]liness
[D](D)You're out there running just to be on the [G]run
[G]Well I got a heart that burns with a [C]fever
[D]And I got a worried and a jealous min[G]d
[G]How can a love that'll last for [C]ever
[D]Get left so far be[G]hind
Chorus
[G]It's a mighty mean and a dreadful [C]sorrow
[D]It's crossed the evil line to [G]day
[G]Well, how can you ask about to [C]morrow
[D]We ain't got one word to [G]say
Chorus
