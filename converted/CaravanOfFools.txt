Caravan of Fools
by John Prine
Live on Tiny Desk Concerts (from NPR’s All Songs Considered)

[Intro]
[Em]   [Am]
[Em][B7][Em]
[Verse 1]
The [Em]dark and distant drumming
The [Am]pounding of the hooves
The [Em]silence of [B7]everything that [Em]moves
[Em]Late at night you’ll see them
Decked [Am]out in shiny jewels
The [Em]coming of the [B7]caravan of [Em]fools

[Verse 2]
Like the [Em]wings of a dove
[Am]   The waiter's white glove
Seems to [Em]shimmer by the [B7]light of the [Em]pool
Some [Em]dull blinding winter
When you [Am]can't help but lose
You're [Em]running with the [B7]caravan of [Em]fools

[Chorus]
The [Em]caravan of fools
The [Am]caravan of fools
You’re [Em]running with the [B7]caravan of [Em]fools

[Instrumental]
[Em]   [Am]
[Em][B7][Em]
[Verse 3]
[Em]Love and devotion
[Am]Deep as any ocean
Don't [Em]play by [B7]anybody's [Em]rules
With your [Em]carousel of horses
And your [Am]unforeseen forces
You're [Em]running with the [B7]caravan of [Em]fools

[Chorus]
The [Em]caravan of fools
The [Am]caravan of fools
You’re [Em]running with the [B7]caravan of [Em]fools

[Instrumental]
[Em]   [Am]
[Em][B7][Em]
