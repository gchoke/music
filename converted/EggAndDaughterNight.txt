“Egg & Daughter Nite, Lincoln Nebraska 1967 (Crazy Bone)”
by John Prine
from the album Tree of Forgiveness
The song’s actually in the key of Eb, but I’m guessing
he plays it in D with the capo on the 1st fret.

[intro]
[D]
[verse]
If you [D]like your apples sweet
And your [D]streets are not concrete
You’d be in your bed by 9 every [A]night
Take your [A]hand-spanked, corn-fed gal
And your [A]best friend’s four-eyed pal
To a [A]treat right down the street that’s [D]dynamite
Well, let your [D]conscience be your guide
If you [D]put your foot inside
You [D7]wish you left your well enough [G]alone
When [G]you got hell to pay,
Put the [D]truth on laya[B7]way and
[E]Blame it on that [A]ol’ crazy [D]bone

[Chorus]
Crazy [G]bone, crazy [D]bone
Well you [E7]wish you left your well enough a[A]lone
When [G]you got hell to pay,
Put the [D]truth on laya[B7]way and
And [E]blame it on that [A]ol’ crazy [D]bone

[Verse]
Don’t be [D]stuck up in Alaska
When you [D]should be up in Nebraska
On a Thursday when it’s egg & daughter [A]nite
When the [A]farmers come to town
And they [A]spread them eggs around
And they [A]drop their daughters down at the roller [D]rink
Well, you’re [D]probably standing there
With your [D]slicked-back Brylcreem hair
Your [D7]Luckys and your daddy’s fine-tooth [G]comb
If they [G]knew what you were thinking,
They’d [D]run you out of [B7]Lincoln
Just [E]blame it on that [A]ol’ crazy [D]bone.

[Chorus]
Crazy [G]bone, crazy [D]bone
Well you [E7]must’ve left your wisdom tooth at [A]home
If they [G]knew what you were thinking,
They’d [D]run you out of [B7]Lincoln
Just [E]blame it on that [A]ol’ crazy [D]bone

[Verse]
When the [D]grandkids all are grown
And they’ve [D]put you in a home
And [D]eternity is approaching [A]fast
Yeah, you’re [A]half out of your head
And you [A]probably pissed the bed
And [A]you can’t see a thing to save your [D]ass
When [D]far across the prairie
In the [D]local cemetery
They [D7]already got your name
Carved out in [G]stone
When [G]all them nurses say,
“Grandpa, [D]why you walk that [B7]way?”
Just [E]blame it on that [A]ol’ crazy [D]bone[B7]
Yeah, [E]blame it on that [A]ol’ crazy

[Chorus]
[G]Bone, crazy [D]bone
And [E7]everybody in that olD folks [A]home
If they [G]knew what you were thinking,
They’d [D]run you out of [B7]Lincoln
Just [E]blame it on that [A]ol’ crazy [D]bone [B7]
And [E]everybody [A]in that ol’ folks [D]home [B7]
Yeah, [E]blame it on that [A]ol’ crazy [D]bone.
