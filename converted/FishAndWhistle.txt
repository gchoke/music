[Verse 1]

[G]I been thinking lately about the [C]people I [G]meet
The [C]carwash on the [G]corner and the [D]hole in the street
The [G]way my ankles hurt with my [C]shoes on my feet
And I'm [G]wondering if I'm [D]gonna see t[G]omorrow

[Chorus]

[G]Father forgive us for [C]what we must [G]do
[C]You forgive [G]us, w[D]e'll forgive you
[G]We'll forgive each other till we [C]both turn blue
Then we'll [G]whistle and go [D]fishing in [G]heaven

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]

[G]I was in the army but I [C]never dug a [G]trench
[C]Used to bust my [G]knuckles on a [D]monkey wrench
I'd [G]go to town and drink, [C]give the girls a pinch
But I [G]don't think they [D]ever really [G]noticed me

[Chorus]
[G]Father forgive us for [C]what we must [G]do
[C]You forgive [G]us, w[D]e'll forgive you
[G]We'll forgive each other till we [C]both turn blue
Then we'll [G]whistle and go [D]fishing in [G]heaven

[Bridge]

[D]Fish and whistle, whistle and fish
[G]Eat everything that they put on your dish
And [C]when we get through we'll [G]make a big wish
That we [A7]never have to do this a[D7]gain, a[D7]gain, a[D7]gain

[Verse 3]
Oh, my [G]very first job I said "[C]thank you and [G]please"
They [C]made me scrub a [G]parking lot [D]down on my knees
[G]Then I got fired for [C]being scared of bees
And they [G]only give me [D]fifty cents an [G]hour


[Chorus]
[G]Father forgive us for [C]what we must [G]do
[C]You forgive [G]us, w[D]e'll forgive you
[G]We'll forgive each other until we [C]both turn blue
Then we'll [G]whistle and go [D]fishing in [G]heaven


[Instrumental]

[Bridge]
[D]Fish and whistle, whistle and fish
[G]Eat everything that they put on your dish
And [C]when we get through we'll [G]make a big wish
That we [A7]never have to do this a[D7]gain, a[D7]gain, a[D7]gain

[Chorus]
Oh, [G]father forgive us for [C]what we must [G]do
[C]You forgive [G]us, w[D]e'll forgive you
[G]We'll forgive each other till we [C]both turn blue
And we'll [G]whistle and go [D]fishing in [G]heaven
We'll [G]whistle and go [D]fishing in [G]heaven
We'll [G]whistle and go [D]fishing in [G]heaven
