Far From Me
by John Prine

Intro:
[C]
As the [C]cafe was [F]closing
On a warm summer [G]night
And [F]cathy was [G]cleaning the [C]spoons
The [F]radio played the [C]hit parade
And [D]I hummed a long with the [G]tune
She [F]asked me to change the [C]station
Said the [F]song just drove her [G]insane
But it [C]werent just the music [F]playing
It was [G]me that she was trying to [C]blame.

Chorus:
And the [F]sky is black and [C]still now
On the [F]hill where the angels [G]sing
Aint it [F]funny how an old broken [C]bottle
Looks [C]just like a [G]diamond [C]ring
But its [F]far, [G]far from [C]me

Well I [C]leaned on my [F]left leg
In the parking lot [G]dirt
And [F]cathy was [G]closing the [C]lights
A [F]june bug flew from the [C]warmth he once knew
Why we [F]used to laugh to[C]gether
And wed [F]dance to any old [G]song.
Well ya [C]know she still laughs [F]with me
But she [G]waits just a second too [C]long.

(Repeat chorus)

Well I [C]started the [F]engine
And I gave it some [G]gas
And [F]cathy was [G]closing her [C]purse
Well we [F]hadnt gone far in my [C]beat old car
And [D]I was prepared for the [G]worst.
[F]Will you still see me to[C]morrow? 
[F]No I got too much to [G]do.
Well a [C]question aint really a [F]question
If you [G]know the answer [C]too.

(Repeat Chorus)
