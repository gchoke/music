[Verse 1]
Well it was [C]all that I could [G7]do to keep from [C]cryin'
Some[F]times it seemed so useless to [C]remain
But [F]you don't have to call me darlin'[C] darlin'
You [C]never even [G7]call me by my [C]name [G7]

[Verse 2]
[C] You don't have [G7]  to call me Waylon [C]Jennings
And you don't have [G7] to call me C[C]harley Pride[C7]
[F]And you don't have to call me [C]Merle Haggard an[Am]ymore
[D7] Even though you're on my fightin'[G7] side

[Chorus 1]
And I'll [F]hang around as long as you will [C]let me 
and I never minded[G7] standing in the [C]rain [C7]
But [F]you don't have to call me darlin'[C] darlin'
You [C]never even [G7]call me by my [C]name [G7]

[Verse 3]
Well [C]I've heard my name [G7]  a few times in your [C]phonebook (hello hello)
And I've [C]seen it on [G7]signs where I've [C]played  [C7]
But the o[F]nly time I know I'll [C]hear David Allan [Am]Coe
Is when [D7]Jesus has his final judgement [G7]day

[Chorus 1]
So I'll [F]hang around as long as you will [C]let me 
and I never minded[G7] standing in the [C]rain [C7]
But [F]you don't have to call me darlin'[C] darlin'
You [C]never even [G7]call me by my [C]name [G7]

[Recitation]
[C](Well a friend of mine named Steve Goodman wrote that song
And he told me i[G]t was the perfect country and western song

I wrote him back a letter and told him

It was not the percfect country and western song
Because he hadn't [C]said anything at all about mama
Or trains [G]  or trucks or prison [C]  or gettin' drunk[G]
Well he sat down [C]and wrote another verse to the song and he sent it to me

And after reading it I realized

That my friend had written the perfect country and western song

And I felt obliged to include it on this album the last verse goes like this here)

[Verse 4]
Well I was [C]drunk the day my [G7]mom got out of [C]prison
And I [C]went to pick her [G7]up in the [C]rain   [C7]
But be[F]fore I could get to the station in a [C]pickup [Am]truck
[D7] She got run'd over by a damned old [G7]train

[Chorus 2]
 So I'll [F]hang around as long as you will [C]let me 
and I never minded[G7] standing in the [C]rain [C7]
But [F]you don't have to call me darlin'[C] darlin'
You [C]never even [G7]call me 
Well I [C]wonder why you don't [F]call me 
Why [C]don't you ever [G7]call me by my [F]name?[C]
