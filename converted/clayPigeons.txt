[Intro]
G C G D , G C G D G

[Chorus]
I'm [G]goin' down to the Greyhound Station, gonna buy a [C]ticket to ride
Gonna [G]find that lady with two or three kids and sit[D] down by her side
[G]Ride 'til the sun comes up and down around me 'bout [C]two or three times
[G]Smokin' cigarettes in the last seat
[D]Sing my song for the people I meet
[G]And get along with it all
[C]where the people say "y'all"
Sing a [G]song with a friend
[D]Change the shape that I'm in,
And [G]get back in the game,
And s[C]tart playin' again  [G]   [D]  [G]

[Verse]
I'd [G]like to stay but I might have to go to [C]start over again
[G]Might go back down to Texas, might go to somewhere [D]that Ive never been
And [G]get up in the mornin' and go out at night
And I won't [C]have to go home
Get used to[G] bein' alone
Change the [D]words to this song
Start [G]singin' again[C]    [G]   [D] [G]

[Instrumental]
G C G D , G C G D G

[Verse]
I'm tired of [G]runnin' round lookin' for answers to questions that I a[C]lready know
I could [G]build me a castle of memories just to have [D]somewhere to go
Count the [G]days and the nights that it takes to get back in the [C]saddle again
Feed the [G]pigeons some clay
Turn the [D]night into day
Start [G]talkin' again, when I [C]know what to say[G]   [D] [G]

[Instrumental]
G C G D , G C G D G

[Chorus]
I'm goin'[G] down to the Greyhound Station, gonna buy a [C]ticket to ride
Gonna [G]find that lady with two or three kids and sit [D]down by her side
[G]Ride 'til the sun comes up and down around me 'bout[C] two or three times
Smokin' [G]cigarettes in the last seat
Sing my [D]song for the people I meet
And get [G]along with it all
[C]where the people say "y'all"
Feed the [G]pigeons some clay
Turn the [D]night into day
Start [G]talkin' again, when I [C]know what to say[G]   [D]  [G]

[Outro]
