[Verse 1]

[C]We had an [Dm]apartment in the [G7]city,
[C]Me and Lo[Dm]retta liked living [G7]there.
[Em]Well its been years since the [F]kids had grown,
A life [C]of their own left [G]us alone.


[C]John and [Dm]Linda live in [G7]Omaha,
[C]And Joe is [Dm]somewhere on the [G7]road.
[Em]We lost Davy in the [F]Korean war,
And I still don't [C]know what for don't matter [G]anymore.


[Chorus]

[A#]Ya know that old trees just grow [C]stronger,
And old [A#]rivers grow wilder every [C]day.
Old [Em]people just grow [F]lonesome
Waiting for [C]someone to say [G]Hello in there, [C]hello.

[Verse 2]

[C]Me and [Dm]Loretta we don't [G7]talk much more,
[C]She sits and [Dm]stares through the back door [G7]screen.
[Em]And all the news just re[F]peats itself
Like some [C]forgotten dream that [G]we've both seen.


[C]Someday [Dm]I'll go and call up [G7]Rudy,
[C]We worked to[Dm]gether at the fac[G7]tory.
[Em]But what could I say if [F]asks What's new
Nothing, [C]what's with you? Nothing [G]much to do.


[Chorus]

[A#]Ya know that old trees just grow [C]stronger,
And old [A#]rivers grow wilder every [C]day.
Old [Em]people just grow [F]lonesome
Waiting for [C]someone to say [G]Hello in there, [C]hello.
