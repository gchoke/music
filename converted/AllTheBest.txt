[Intro]
| C    Csus4 C | C    Csus4 C | C    Csus4 C | C    Csus4 C | C      |

[Verse 1]
I wish you [C]love [Csus4]     [C]
And happi[C]ness [Csus4]     [C]
I guess I [C]wish
[G]  You [C]all the best
I wish you [C]don't[Csus4]     [C]
Do like I [C]do [Csus4]     [C]
And ever [C]fall in love with
Some[G]one like [C]you

[Chorus]
'Cause if you[F] feel
Just like I [C]did
You'd probably [C]walk around the block
Like a little [G]kid
But kids don't [C]know [Csus4]     [C]
They can only [C]guess [Csus4]     [C]
How hard it [C]is
To [G]wish you happi[C]ness

[Instrumental]
| C    Csus4 C | C    Csus4 C | C    Csus4 C | G       | C      |

[Verse 2]
I guess that [C]love [Csus4]     [C]
Is like a Christmas [C]card [Csus4]     [C]
You decorate a [C]tree
You [G]throw it in the [C]yard
It decays and [C]dies [Csus4]     [C]
And the snowmen [C]melt [Csus4]     [C]
Well I once [C]knew love
[G]  I knew how love [C]felt

[Chorus]
Yeah I knew [F]love
Love knew [C]me

And when I walked
Love walked with [G]me
And I got no [C]hate [Csus4]     [C]
And I got no [C]pride [Csus4]     [C]
Well I [C]got so much
[G]love that I cannot [C]hide
Well I [C]got so much
[G]love that I cannot [C]hide

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
Say you drive a [C]Chevy [Csus4]     [C]
Say you drive a [C]Ford  [Csus4]     [C]
You say you [C]drive around the
[G]town till you just get [C]bored
Then you change your [C]mind [Csus4]     [C]
For something else to [C]do [Csus4]     [C]
And your [C]heart gets bored with your
[G]mind and it changes [C]you

[Chorus]
Well it's a doggone [F]shame
And it's an awful [C]mess

I wish you love
[G]I wish you happi[C]ness
I wish you [C]love
[G]  I wish you happi[C]ness

[Outro]
I guess I [C]wis[G]h    you all the [C]best
| C    Csus4 C | C    Csus4 C | C    Csus4 C | G     | C      |
