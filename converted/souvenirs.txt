Intro:
[D][A7][G][D]
[D][A7][G][D]
All the snow has turned to [G]water,[A7]
Christmas days have come and [D]gone.
Broken toys and [G]faded colours [A7]are all that's left to linger [D]on.
I hate graveyards and old [G]pawn shops,[A7]
For they always bring me [D]tears.
I can't forgive the way they [G]robbed me of my [A7]childhood souve[D]nirs.
Chorus:
[A7]Memories, they can't be [D]boughten.
[A7]They can't be won at carnivals for [D]free.
[A7]Well it took me years to [D]get those souvenirs,
And i [G]don't know how they slipped away from [A7]me.
Broken hearts and dirty [G]windows [A7]
Make life difficult to [D]see.
That's why last night and this [G]morning [A7]
Always look the same to [D]me.
And I hate reading old love [G]letters[A7]
For they always bring me [D]tears.
I can't forget the way they [G]robbed me,[A7]
Of my sweetheart's souve[D]nirs.
[A7]Memories, they can't be [D]boughten.
[A7]They can't be won at carnivals for [D]free.
[A7]Well it took me years to [D]get those souvenirs,
And i [G]don't know how they slipped away from [A7]me.
