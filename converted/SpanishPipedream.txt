[Verse 1]
[G6/D]She was a [G]level headed dancer on the [C]road to alcohol.
And [D7]I was just a soldier on my way to Montre[G]al.
Well she [G]pressed her chest against me,
About the [C]time the jukebox broke.
Yeah, she [D7]gave me a peck on the back of the neck,
And these are the words she [G]spoke.

[Chorus 1]
Blow up your [G]T.V.. Throw away your paper.
Go to the [D]country.  Build you a [G]home.
Plant a little [G]garden.  Eat a lotta peaches.
Try an find [D]Jesus,  on your [G]own.

[Verse 2]
Well, I [G]sat there at the table, and I [C]acted real naive.
For I [D7]knew that topless lady, had something up her s[G]leeve.
Well, she [G]danced around the bar room, and she [C]did the hoochy-coo.
Yeah she [D7]sang her song all night long, tellin' me what to d[G]o.

[Chorus 2]
Blow up your [G]T.V.  Throw away your paper.
Go to the [D]country.  Build you a [G]home.
Plant a little [G]garden.  Eat a lot of peaches.
Try an' find [D]Jesus, on your [G]own.

[Verse 3]
Well, [G]I was young and hungry, and a[C]bout to leave that place.
When [D7]just as I was leavin', well she looked me in the [G]face.
I said "[G]You must know the answer".  She said "[C]No but I'll give it a try".
And to [D7]this very day, we've been livin' our way. 
And here is the reason [G]why.

[Chorus 3]
We blew up our [G]T.V.  Threw away our paper.
Went to the [D]country, built us a [G]home.
Had a lot of [G]children, fed 'em on peaches.
They all found [D]Jesus, on their [G]own. [C]  [G]
