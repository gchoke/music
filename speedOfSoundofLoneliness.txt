:Speed The Sound Of Loneliness 
John Prine 

G                                    C
You come home late and you come home early
D                                   G
You come on big when you're feeling small
G                                        C
You come home straight and you come home curly
D                                G
Sometimes you don't come home at all

Chorus:
                            C
So what in the world's come over you
D                                G
And what in heaven's name have I done
                                             C
You've broken the speed of the sound of lone liness
D                                             G
(D)You're out there running just to be on the run

G                                    C
Well I got a heart that burns with a fever
D                                    G
And I got a worried and a jealous mind
G                               C
How can a love that'll last for ever
D                 G
Get left so far behind

Chorus

G                                 C
It's a mighty mean and a dreadful sorrow
D                             G
It's crossed the evil line to day
G                              C
Well, how can you ask about to morrow
D                        G
We ain't got one word to say

Chorus
