[Verse 1]
           C    Csus4 C
I wish you love
         C    Csus4 C
And happiness
          C
I guess I wish
G     C
  You all the best
           C    Csus4 C
I wish you don't
          C  Csus4 C
Do like I do
         C
And ever fall in love with
    G        C
Someone like you
 
[Chorus]
             F
'Cause if you feel
            C
Just like I did
               C
You'd probably walk around the block
              G
Like a little kid
               C    Csus4 C
But kids don't know
              C     Csus4 C
They can only guess
            C
How hard it is
   G             C
To wish you happiness
 
[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
             C    Csus4 C
I guess that love
                    C    Csus4 C
Is like a Christmas card
               C
You decorate a tree
    G               C
You throw it in the yard
              C    Csus4 C
It decays and dies
                C    Csus4 C
And the snowmen melt
            C
Well I once knew love
G                 C
  I knew how love felt
 
[Chorus]
            F
Yeah I knew love
          C
Love knew me
 
And when I walked
                 G
Love walked with me
             C    Csus4 C
And I got no hate
             C     Csus4 C
And I got no pride
       C
Well I got so much
G                  C
love that I cannot hide
       C
Well I got so much
G                  C
love that I cannot hide

[Verse 3]
                C     Csus4 C
Say you drive a Chevy
                C     Csus4 C
Say you drive a Ford
            C
You say you drive around the
G                      C
town till you just get bored
                     C    Csus4 C
Then you change your mind
                      C  Csus4 C
For something else to do
         C
And your heart gets bored with your
G                   C
mind and it changes you
 
[Chorus]
                    F
Well it's a doggone shame
                  C
And it's an awful mess
 
I wish you love
G               C
I wish you happiness
           C
I wish you love
G                 C
  I wish you happiness
 
[Outro]
          C  G                C
I guess I wish    you all the best
| C    Csus4 C | C    Csus4 C | C    Csus4 C | G     | C      |
