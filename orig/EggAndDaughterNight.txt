“Egg & Daughter Nite, Lincoln Nebraska 1967 (Crazy Bone)”
by John Prine
from the album Tree of Forgiveness
The song’s actually in the key of Eb, but I’m guessing
he plays it in D with the capo on the 1st fret.

[verse]
       D
If you like your apples sweet
         D
And your streets are not concrete
                                A
You’d be in your bed by 9 every night
          A
Take your hand-spanked, corn-fed gal
         A
And your best friend’s four-eyed pal
     A                                  D
To a treat right down the street that’s dynamite
               D
Well, let your conscience be your guide
       D
If you put your foot inside
    D7                             G
You wish you left your well enough alone
     G
When you got hell to pay,
        D            B7
Put the truth on layaway and
E                A         D
Blame it on that ol’ crazy bone
 
[Chorus]
      G           D
Crazy bone, crazy bone
         E7                              A
Well you wish you left your well enough alone
     G
When you got hell to pay,
        D            B7
Put the truth on layaway and
    E                A         D
And blame it on that ol’ crazy bone
 
[Verse]
         D
Don’t be stuck up in Alaska
         D
When you should be up in Nebraska
                                       A
On a Thursday when it’s egg & daughter nite
         A
When the farmers come to town
         A
And they spread them eggs around
         A                                       D
And they drop their daughters down at the roller rink
             D
Well, you’re probably standing there
          D
With your slicked-back Brylcreem hair
     D7                                 G
Your Luckys and your daddy’s fine-tooth comb
        G
If they knew what you were thinking,
       D              B7
They’d run you out of Lincoln
     E                A         D
Just blame it on that ol’ crazy bone.
 
[Chorus]
      G           D
Crazy bone, crazy bone
         E7                                A
Well you must’ve left your wisdom tooth at home
        G
If they knew what you were thinking,
       D              B7
They’d run you out of Lincoln
     E                A         D
Just blame it on that ol’ crazy bone

[Verse]
         D
When the grandkids all are grown
            D
And they’ve put you in a home
    D                       A
And eternity is approaching fast
             A
Yeah, you’re half out of your head
        A
And you probably pissed the bed
    A                                  D
And you can’t see a thing to save your ass
     D
When far across the prairie
       D
In the local cemetery
     D7
They already got your name
              G
Carved out in stone
     G
When all them nurses say,
          D                 B7
“Grandpa, why you walk that way?”
     E                A         D    B7
Just blame it on that ol’ crazy bone
      E                A
Yeah, blame it on that ol’ crazy
 
[Chorus]
G           D
Bone, crazy bone
    E7                          A
And everybody in that olD folks home
        G
If they knew what you were thinking,
       D              B7
They’d run you out of Lincoln
     E                A         D     B7
Just blame it on that ol’ crazy bone
    E         A                 D     B7
And everybody in that ol’ folks home
      E                A         D
Yeah, blame it on that ol’ crazy bone.
