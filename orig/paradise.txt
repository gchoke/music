     C                           F              C
Well sometimes we'd travel right down the Green River
       Cm                           G     C
To the abandoned old prison down by Adrie Hill
          Csus                             F              C
Where the air smelled like snakes and we'd shoot with our pistols
    C                     G            C
But empty pop bottles was all we would kill.
