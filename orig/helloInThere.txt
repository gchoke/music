[Verse 1]
 
C         Dm               G7
We had an apartment in the city,
C        Dm                 G7
Me and Loretta liked living there.
Em                            F
Well its been years since the kids had grown,
       C                 G
A life of their own left us alone.
 
 
C        Dm            G7
John and Linda live in Omaha,
C          Dm               G7
And Joe is somewhere on the road.
Em                  F
We lost Davy in the Korean war,
                  C                          G
And I still don't know what for don't matter anymore.
 
 
[Chorus]
 
A#                               C
Ya know that old trees just grow stronger,
        A#                       C
And old rivers grow wilder every day.
    Em               F
Old people just grow lonesome
            C              G               C
Waiting for someone to say Hello in there, hello.

[Verse 2]
 
C      Dm               G7
Me and Loretta we don't talk much more,
C            Dm                           G7
She sits and stares through the back door screen.
Em                      F
And all the news just repeats itself
          C                    G
Like some forgotten dream that we've both seen.
 
 
C       Dm                  G7
Someday I'll go and call up Rudy,
C           Dm               G7
We worked together at the factory.
Em                      F
But what could I say if asks What's new
         C                        G
Nothing, what's with you? Nothing much to do.
 
 
[Chorus]
 
A#                               C
Ya know that old trees just grow stronger,
        A#                       C
And old rivers grow wilder every day.
    Em               F
Old people just grow lonesome
            C              G               C
Waiting for someone to say Hello in there, hello.
