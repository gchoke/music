[Verse 1]
G6/D      G                          C
She was a level headed dancer on the road to alcohol.
    D7                                      G
And I was just a soldier on my way to Montreal.
         G
Well she pressed her chest against me,
          C
About the time the jukebox broke.
          D7
Yeah, she gave me a peck on the back of the neck,
                            G
And these are the words she spoke.
 
[Chorus 1]
             G
Blow up your T.V.. Throw away your paper.
          D                     G
Go to the country.  Build you a home.
               G
Plant a little garden.  Eat a lotta peaches.
            D               G
Try an find Jesus,  on your own.
 
[Verse 2]
        G                             C
Well, I sat there at the table, and I acted real naive.
      D7                                            G
For I knew that topless lady, had something up her sleeve.
          G                                   C
Well, she danced around the bar room, and she did the hoochy-coo.
         D7                                                G  
Yeah she sang her song all night long, tellin' me what to do.
 
[Chorus 2]
             G
Blow up your T.V.  Throw away your paper.
          D                     G
Go to the country.  Build you a home.
               G
Plant a little garden.  Eat a lot of peaches.
             D              G
Try an' find Jesus, on your own.

[Verse 3]
      G                            C
Well, I was young and hungry, and about to leave that place.
     D7                                               G
When just as I was leavin', well she looked me in the face.
        G                                     C
I said "You must know the answer".  She said "No but I'll give it a try".
       D7
And to this very day, we've been livin' our way. 
                       G  
And here is the reason why.
 
[Chorus 3]
               G
We blew up our T.V.  Threw away our paper.
            D                   G
Went to the country, built us a home.
             G
Had a lot of children, fed 'em on peaches.
               D               G    C  G
They all found Jesus, on their own.
