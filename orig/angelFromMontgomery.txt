ANGEL FROM MONTGOMERY
 
[Verse 1]
G           C     G              C
I am an old woman named after my mother.
G              C      D                  G
My old man is another child that's grown old.
               C             G              C
If dreams were lightning and thunder were desire
G                       C            D         G
this old house would've burnt down a long time ago.
 
[Chorus]
G          F          C          G
Make me an angel that flies from Montgomery.
          F            C       G
Make me a poster of an old rodeo.
             F              C          G
Just give me one thing that I can hold on to.
                   C                D           G    C   G   C G C G
To believe in this living is just a hard way to go.
 
[Verse 2]
G            C         G           C
When I was a young girl I had me a cowboy,
G                  C               D             G
He wa'rn't much to look at, just a free ramblin' man.
              C          G                  C
But that was a long time, and no matter how I try,
G              C              D           G
the years just flow by like a broken-down dam.
 
[Chorus]
G          F          C          G
Make me an angel that flies from Montgomery.
          F            C       G
Make me a poster of an old rodeo.
             F              C          G
Just give me one thing that I can hold on to.
                   C                D           G    C   G   C G C G
To believe in this living is just a hard way to go.
 
[Verse 3]
G                    C      G                      C
There's flies in the kitchen, I can hear all their buzzin'
G                C               D         G
but I ain't done nothin' since I woke up today.
                       C     G                  C
But how the hell can a person go to work in the morning
G                C                D          G
come home in the evenin' and have nothin' to say?
 
[Chorus]
G          F          C              G
Make me an angel that flies from Montgomery.
          F            C       G
Make me a poster of an old rodeo.
             F              C          G
Just give me one thing that I can hold on to.
                   C                D           G    C   G   C G C G
To believe in this living is just a hard way to go.
