[Verse 1]
            C                G7              C
Well it was all that I could do to keep from cryin'
    F                             C
Sometimes it seemed so useless to remain
    F                                C
But you don't have to call me darlin' darlin'
    C          G7            C     G7
You never even call me by my name
 
[Verse 2]
C               G7                  C
 You don't have   to call me Waylon Jennings
                   G7           C           C7
And you don't have  to call me Charley Pride
F                             C               Am
And you don't have to call me Merle Haggard anymore
D7                                G7
 Even though you're on my fightin' side
 
[Chorus 1]
         F                               C
And I'll hang around as long as you will let me 
                  G7               C     C7
and I never minded standing in the rain
    F                                C
But you don't have to call me darlin' darlin'
    C          G7            C     G7
You never even call me by my name
 
[Verse 3]
     C                  G7                    C
Well I've heard my name   a few times in your phonebook (hello hello)
         C          G7               C        C7
And I've seen it on signs where I've played
         F                    C                Am
But the only time I know I'll hear David Allan Coe
        D7                            G7
Is when Jesus has his final judgement day
 
[Chorus 1]
        F                               C
So I'll hang around as long as you will let me 
                  G7               C     C7
and I never minded standing in the rain
    F                                C
But you don't have to call me darlin' darlin'
    C          G7            C     G7
You never even call me by my name
 
[Recitation]
C
(Well a friend of mine named Steve Goodman wrote that song
                G
And he told me it was the perfect country and western song
 
I wrote him back a letter and told him
 
It was not the percfect country and western song
                  C
Because he hadn't said anything at all about mama
          G                     C                  G
Or trains   or trucks or prison   or gettin' drunk
                 C
Well he sat down and wrote another verse to the song and he sent it to me
 
And after reading it I realized
 
That my friend had written the perfect country and western song
 
And I felt obliged to include it on this album the last verse goes like this here)
 
[Verse 4]
           C                G7             C
Well I was drunk the day my mom got out of prison
      C                G7        C       C7
And I went to pick her up in the rain
      F                                    C      Am
But before I could get to the station in a pickup truck
D7                                  G7
 She got run'd over by a damned old train
 
[Chorus 2]
         F                               C
 So I'll hang around as long as you will let me 
                  G7               C     C7
and I never minded standing in the rain
    F                                C
But you don't have to call me darlin' darlin'
    C          G7
You never even call me 
       C                    F
Well I wonder why you don't call me 
    C              G7            F    C
Why don't you ever call me by my name?
