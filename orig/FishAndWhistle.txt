[Verse 1]
 
G                                C        G
I been thinking lately about the people I meet
    C              G              D
The carwash on the corner and the hole in the street
    G                          C
The way my ankles hurt with my shoes on my feet
        G                D          G
And I'm wondering if I'm gonna see tomorrow
 
[Chorus]
 
G                     C            G
Father forgive us for what we must do
C           G    D
You forgive us, we'll forgive you
G                                C
We'll forgive each other till we both turn blue
           G              D          G
Then we'll whistle and go fishing in heaven
 
[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
 
G                       C           G
I was in the army but I never dug a trench
C               G             D
Used to bust my knuckles on a monkey wrench
    G                     C
I'd go to town and drink, give the girls a pinch
      G                D           G
But I don't think they ever really noticed me
 
[Chorus]
G                     C            G
Father forgive us for what we must do
C           G    D
You forgive us, we'll forgive you
G                                C
We'll forgive each other till we both turn blue
           G              D          G
Then we'll whistle and go fishing in heaven
 
[Bridge]
 
D
Fish and whistle, whistle and fish
G
Eat everything that they put on your dish
    C                         G
And when we get through we'll make a big wish
        A7                     D7     D7     D7
That we never have to do this again, again, again
 
[Verse 3]
       G                      C             G
Oh, my very first job I said "thank you and please"
     C               G           D
They made me scrub a parking lot down on my knees
G                    C
Then I got fired for being scared of bees
         G            D              G
And they only give me fifty cents an hour
 
 
[Chorus]
G                     C            G
Father forgive us for what we must do
C           G    D
You forgive us, we'll forgive you
G                                 C
We'll forgive each other until we both turn blue
           G              D          G
Then we'll whistle and go fishing in heaven

        A7                     D7     D7     D7
That we never have to do this again, again, again

We'll whistle and go fishing in heaven
