[Verse 1]
       G                           C
It was Christmas in prison and the food was real good
       G                                D
We had turkey and pistols carved out of wood
      G                         C
And I dream of her always ,even when I don't dream
    G                          D            G
Her names on my tongue and her bloods in my stream
 
[Chorus]
 
D            C     G
Wait a while eternity 
C                       G          D
old Mother Nature's got nothing on me
G
Come to me, run to me
C
Come to me now
      G
We're rolling my sweetheart 
      D          G
We're flowing by God

[Verse 2]
    G                               C
She reminds me of a chess game with someone I admire
     G                                  D
Or a picnic in the rain after a prairie fire
    G                       C
Her heart is as big as this whole goddamn jail
        G                           D          G
And she sweeter than saccharin at a drug store sale
 
[Chorus]
D           C     G
Wait awhile eternity 
C                       G          D
Old Mother Nature's got nothing on me
G
Come to me , run to me 
C
Come to me now
      G
We're rolling my sweetheart 
      D          G
We're flowing by god

[Verse 3]
    G                                   C
The search light in the big yard swings round with the gun
        G                                                 D
And the spotlights in the snowflakes,like the dust in the sun
     G                                C
It's Christmas in prison, there'll be music tonight
     G                        D            G
I'll probably get homesick, I love you goodnight 
 
[Chorus]
D            C     G
Wait a while eternity 
C                       G          D
Old Mother Nature's got nothing on me
G
Come to me, run to me
C
Come to me now
      G
We're rolling my sweetheart 
      D          G
We're flowing by God
