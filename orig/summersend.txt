[Verse 1]
C                                       Em
Summer’s end’s   around the bend just    flying
   C                                       Em
The swimming suits   are on the line just    drying
    F                                  G
I’ll meet you there    per our conver - sation
 F                                 G
I hope I didn’t   ruin your whole vacation

[Verse 2]

        C                                       Em
Well you never know   how far from home you’re    feeling
 C                                      Em
Until you watch   the shadows cross the   ceiling
    F                                  G
Well I don’t know,   but I can see it    snowing
F                                    G
In your car   the windows are   wide open



[Chorus]
            C                 Am
Just come on home      come on home
            F                G
No you don’t have to      be alone
            C 
Just come on home.
 (Intro)
[Verse 3]
C                                        Em
Valentines   break hearts and minds at    random
        C                                 Em
That ol’ Easter egg   ain’t got a leg to    stand on
    F                                    G
Well I can see   that you can’t win for    trying
   F                                        G
And New Year’s Eve   is bound to leave you    crying

[Chorus]
       C                 Am
Come on home      come on home
            F                G
No you don’t have to      be alone
            F     G     F     G
Just come on home.

[Verse 4]
   C                                          Em
The moon and stars   hang out in bars just    talking
C                                   Em
I still love   that picture of us    walking
F                                         G
Just like that ol’ house we thought was    haunted
F                                    G
Summer’s end   came faster than we    wanted

[Chorus]
       C                 Am
Come on home      come on home
            F                G
No you don’t have to      be alone
       C                 Am
Come on home      come on home
            F                G
No you don’t have to      be alone
            C
Just come on home.
