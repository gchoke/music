by John Prine
from the album Tree of Forgiveness
 
[Intro]
C
 
[Chorus]
C
The lonesome friends of science say
F
The world will end most any day
C
Well, if it does, then that's okay
G
Cuz I don't live here anyway
C
I live down deep inside my head
F
Where long ago I made my bed
C
I get my mail in Tennessee
G
My wife, my dog, and my family
      C
Uh-huh
 
[Verse]
C
Poor old planet Pluto now
F
He never stood a chance no how
C
When he got uninvited to
G
The interplanetary dance
C
Once a mighty planet there
F
Now just an ordinary star
C
Hanging out in Hollywood
G
In some ol' funky sushi bar
 
[Chorus]
C
The lonesome friends of science say
F
The world will end most any day
C
Well, if it does, then that's okay
G
Cuz I don't live here anyway
C
I live down deep inside my head
F
Where long ago I made my bed
C
I get my mail in Tennessee
G
My wife, my dog, and my kids, and me
      C
Uh-huh
 
[Verse]
    C
The Vulcan lives in Birmingham
F
Sometimes he just don't give a damn
C
His head is full of bumblebees
G
His pride hangs down below his knees
C
Venus left him long ago
F
For a guy named Mars from Idaho
C
The Vulcan sent a wedding gift:
G
Three-legged stool and a wheelchair lift
   C
Uh-huh
 
[Chorus]
C
The lonesome friends of science say
F
The world will end most any day
C
Well, if it does, then that's okay
G
Cuz I don't live here anyway
C
I live down deep inside my head
F
Where long ago I made my bed
C
I get my mail in Tennessee
G
My wife, my dog, my kids, and me
      C    Am
Uh-huh, uh-huh
      C    Am
Uh-huh, uh-huh
      C
Uh-huh
 
[Verse]
C
Those bastards in their white lab coats
F
Who experiment with mountain goats
C
Should leave the universe alone
G
It's not their business, not their home
C
I go to sleep, and it never rains
F
My dog predicts hurricanes
C
She can smell a storm a mile away
G
That's all the news we have today
C
Uh-huh
 
[Chorus]
C
The lonesome friends of science say
F
The world will end most any day
C
Well, if it does, then that's okay
G
Cuz I don't live here anyway
C
I live down deep inside my head
F
Where long ago I made my bed
C
I get my mail in Tennessee
G
My wife, my dog, my kids, and me
      C    Am
Uh-huh, uh-huh
      C    Am
Uh-huh, uh-huh
      C
Uh-huh
