[Intro]
G C G D , G C G D G
 
[Chorus]
    G                                                C
I'm goin' down to the Greyhound Station, gonna buy a ticket to ride
      G                                            D
Gonna find that lady with two or three kids and sit down by her side
G                                                   C
Ride 'til the sun comes up and down around me 'bout two or three times
G
Smokin' cigarettes in the last seat
D
Sing my song for the people I meet
G
And get along with it all
C
where the people say "y'all"
       G
Sing a song with a friend
D
Change the shape that I'm in,
    G
And get back in the game,
     C                   G  D  G
And start playin' again
 
[Verse]
    G                                      C
I'd like to stay but I might have to go to start over again
G                                                  D
Might go back down to Texas, might go to somewhere that Ive never been
    G
And get up in the mornin' and go out at night
            C
And I won't have to go home
           G
Get used to bein' alone
           D
Change the words to this song
      G            C   G  D G
Start singin' again
 
[Instrumental]
G C G D , G C G D G
 
[Verse]
             G                                                      C
I'm tired of runnin' round lookin' for answers to questions that I already know
        G                                          D
I could build me a castle of memories just to have somewhere to go
          G                                                    C
Count the days and the nights that it takes to get back in the saddle again
         G
Feed the pigeons some clay
         D
Turn the night into day
      G                     C               G  D G
Start talkin' again, when I know what to say
 
[Instrumental]
G C G D , G C G D G
 
[Chorus]
         G                                           C
I'm goin' down to the Greyhound Station, gonna buy a ticket to ride
      G                                             D
Gonna find that lady with two or three kids and sit down by her side
G                                                  C
Ride 'til the sun comes up and down around me 'bout two or three times
        G
Smokin' cigarettes in the last seat
        D
Sing my song for the people I meet
        G
And get along with it all
C
where the people say "y'all"
         G
Feed the pigeons some clay
         D
Turn the night into day
      G                     C               G  D  G
Start talkin' again, when I know what to say
