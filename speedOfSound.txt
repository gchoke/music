G                      C
You come home late and you come home early
D                    G
You come on big when you're feeling small
G                          C
You come home straight and you come home curly
D                   G
Sometimes you don't come home at all

Chorus:
                       C
So what in the world's come over you
D                    G
And what in heaven's name have I done
                           C
You've broken the speed of the sound of loneliness
D                             G
You're out there running just to be on the run
